		<h1 class="title">End-User License Agreement ("Agreement")</h1>
	
		<p class="updated">Last updated: October 23, 2021</p>

		<p>Please read this End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") carefully before using TopNotch ("Application").</p>

		<p>By using the Application, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
		
		<p>This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Make The Web Oślizło & Magiera s. c., address: ul. Wałowa 49, 44‐300 Wodzisław Śląski (Poland), NIP: 6472582030 ("MTW") and it governs your use of the Application made available to you by MTW.</p>

		<p>If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Application.</p>

		<p>The Application is licensed, not sold, to you by MTW for use strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

		<p>We respect consumer rights, whereby a “Consumer” is understood as any natural person who in agreements acts for purposes other than connected with business, economic or craft activity or freelance profession. A Consumer may not waive the rights granted thereto by relevant legal acts. Any agreement provisions which are less favourable to a consumer than provisions in relevant legal acts protecting consumers shall be invalid, and the respective statutory provisions shall be used instead. That is why the provisions of the Agreement are not intended to exclude or limit any consumer rights granted thereto under unconditionally applicable legal provisions, any possible doubts should be clarified to the advantage of a consumer. In the case of any discrepancy between the provisions of the Agreement with the foregoing provisions, these provisions shall prevail and be applicable.</p>

		<p>In particular, MTW shall not apply towards consumers the provisions of the Agreement which exclude or considerably limit the liability towards a consumer for non-performance or improper performance of our liabilities. In the case of consumers, we shall not make performance of the Agreement dependant on circumstances under our sole control, we shall apply neither the right to binding interpretation of the Agreement nor other provisions which would grossly infringe consumer’s interest.</p>

		<p>Please remember also that a consumer shall not enjoy the right to withdraw from an agreement concluded from the remote with regard to service agreements if the entrepreneur provided the service fully upon express consent of the consumer who had been informed before starting the performance that upon completion of the performance by the entrepreneur he/she will lose the right to withdraw from the agreement.</p>

		<p>Save for consumers, MTW shall not be liable against users for any lost profit and damage resulting from unintentional fault.</p>
		
		<h2>License</h2>

		<p>MTW grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install and use the Application strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

		<p>You acknowledge and agree that MTW shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof. MTW does not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for any Third-Party Services.</p>

		<h2>Term and Termination</h2>

		<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, you shall cease all use of the Application and delete all copies of the Application from your computer.</p>

		<p>Termination of this Agreement will not limit any of MTW's rights or remedies at law or in equity in case of breach by you (during the term of this Agreement) of any of your obligations under the present Agreement.</p>

		<h2>Indemnification</h2>

		<p>You agree to indemnify and hold MTW and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (if any) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of the Application; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.</p>

		<h2>No Warranties</h2>

		<p>The Application is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, MTW, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, MTW provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

		<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither MTW nor any MTW's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Application, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Application will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Application; or (iv) that the Application, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of MTW are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>

		<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>

		<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

		<p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of MTW and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the Application.</p>

		<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall MTW or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if MTW or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

		<p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

		<h2>Severability</h2>

		<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

		<h2>Waiver</h2>

		<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>

		<h2>Amendments to this Agreement</h2>

		<p>MTW may amend the Agreement due to material reasons, whether legal (amendment of generally applicable law or change of the organizational form of MTW) or technical (modernization of the Application, change of the operation manner of the Application).</p>
